# GitCodeGud
## Competition: 
**boot.dev, devActivity, BountyHub**

On **boot.dev**, users can learn programming and earn XP in the process.
On **devActivity**, users can gain experience while contributing to a project and earn XP.
On **BountyHub**, users can fix bugs in other people’s repositories for money, but the platform lacks skill progression, personal development features, and gamification.

## Description: 
This application would assist programmers by allowing them to link their git repositories to the GitCodeGud platform. This way, they can work on their tasks as usual, but on the GitCodeGud platform, other programmers can fix bugs in other people’s projects in exchange for XP. Additional XP can also be earned for successful pull requests or even for discovering a bug (fixed amount).

## Theme:
 Bug hunting, with a modern, more engaging look and feel.

## Technology stack:
GitHub/GitLab login using OAuth2 (Laravel Socialite)
PostgreSQL database for storing data
Vue.js, Tailwind CSS – frontend
Laravel – backend
